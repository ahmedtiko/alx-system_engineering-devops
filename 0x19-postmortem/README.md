# Postmortem: The Great Outage of June 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** June 5, 2024, 14:00 - 17:00 UTC

**Impact:** Our primary web application was down, affecting approximately 85% of our users. Customers experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors when trying to access the website.

**Root Cause:** A misconfigured load balancer update caused all traffic to be routed to a single, overwhelmed server.

## Timeline

- **14:00** - Issue detected: Monitoring alert triggered due to increased error rates.
- **14:05** - Initial investigation began: Logs and metrics from web servers and databases reviewed.
- **14:15** - Misleading path: Assumed a database bottleneck due to a recent update.
- **14:30** - Incident escalated to the DevOps team.
- **14:45** - Further investigation: Checked application logs, server health, and network configurations.
- **15:00** - Realization: Discovered traffic was being funneled to one server.
- **15:10** - Corrective action: Rolled back the recent load balancer configuration update.
- **15:30** - Confirmed traffic distribution normalized, errors decreased.
- **17:00** - Full service restoration confirmed after monitoring system stability.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a recent update to the load balancer configuration. During a scheduled maintenance window, a new rule intended to optimize traffic distribution was added. However, due to a typo in the configuration file, all incoming requests were directed to a single server rather than being distributed across the server pool. This server quickly became overloaded, leading to 503 Service Unavailable errors for the majority of users.

**Resolution:**
Upon identifying the misconfiguration, the team immediately rolled back the load balancer configuration to the previous, stable version. This action redistributed traffic evenly across all servers, alleviating the load on the single overwhelmed server. Subsequent monitoring confirmed that error rates returned to normal and the service was fully restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**
- Implement a stricter review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and automated syntax checks.
- Enhance monitoring to detect traffic distribution anomalies in real-time.
- Improve the incident response process to include quicker identification and rollback of recent changes.

**Task List:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Update Nginx to the latest version to include improved load balancing features.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns and server load imbalances.
3. **Configuration Management:** Implement automated validation tools for configuration files to catch syntax errors before deployment.
4. **Training:** Conduct a training session for the DevOps team on best practices for configuration changes and incident response.
5. **Documentation:** Update the incident response playbook to include steps for quickly reverting recent changes and guidelines for load balancer configurations.

**Conclusion:**
Despite the initial chaos, the outage served as a valuable learning experience. By tightening our processes and improving our systems, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future. And remember, always double-check your configsâ€”especially before hitting save!
